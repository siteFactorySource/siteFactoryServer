# siteFactoryServer
siteFactoryServer is a feature rich PHP-Framework with lots of not required, but practical functions how the DOM class (a server-side Document-Object-Model) or the WebServer class (for example for simple sending headers).<br>
Today I haven't wrot any documentation for it, but in the next future I want to write a documentation.
